With the enhancement of LLM AI performance, almost all computing environments are undergoing a transformation. In particular, conversational AI has begun to serve as the interface for various services. Although the capability of AI is improving to the point where standard specifications are no longer necessary, it is still important to build an environment where collaboration between AIs can be faster, more accurate, and trustworthy. Just as existing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable the integration of various applications, defining and using an AI Interface is expected to play a key role in environments where massive AI agents provide services.

### AI Agent Communication, Interaction, and Trust Interface Specification

#### 1. **Overview**
This document defines an interface for enabling communication, interaction, and trust between AI Agents. AI Agents can collaborate in various services, and this document outlines the necessary communication protocols and mechanisms for ensuring reliable cooperation. The specification particularly targets environments with large-scale AI, including LLM AI, facilitating seamless collaboration.

#### 2. **Purpose**
The purpose of this interface is to standardize interactions between AI Agents, ensuring:
- Efficient data exchange and task execution
- Quick recovery from errors during communication
- Secure and trustworthy interaction environments
- Natural language-based communication and complex problem-solving

#### 3. **Key Interface Functions**

##### 3.1. **Standard Communication Protocols**
Standard protocols such as REST API, gRPC, and WebSocket will be used for data transmission between AIs. This ensures:
- **Synchronous and asynchronous communication**: Supports both synchronous and asynchronous interactions based on task requirements.
- **High-speed data transfer and minimal response time**: Ensures immediate data transmission and fast responses without delays.

##### 3.2. **Data Format and Interaction**
Data exchange between AIs will use standard formats such as JSON, XML, and Protobuf to maintain a consistent data structure. This allows for:
- **Structured data exchange**: Ensures smooth interaction by maintaining consistent data formats.
- **Flexible data extensibility**: Data formats can be extended to accommodate various AI models and systems.

##### 3.3. **Trust-Based Authentication and Encryption**
Security is crucial for AI communication. The following mechanisms are employed:
- **OAuth 2.0 and JWT-based authentication**: Ensures trust between AI Agents through secure authentication and authorization.
- **TLS encrypted communication**: Ensures that data transmitted between AIs is encrypted and secure.

##### 3.4. **Error Handling and Recovery**
Error handling is performed with an automatic recovery mechanism. Key features include:
- **Automatic retry mechanism**: Guarantees reliability by retrying data transmission in case of failure.
- **Error logging and analysis**: Automatically logs and analyzes errors for troubleshooting and improvement.

##### 3.5. **State Management**
For conversational AIs or workflows requiring continuous interaction, state management features are included:
- **Session persistence**: Maintains the flow of interactions, allowing multiple AIs to share the same task state.
- **State transition logging**: Tracks the state changes during task execution, ensuring smooth collaboration.

##### 3.6. **Natural Language Communication Between AIs**
The interface supports natural language communication between AIs, enabling complex queries and responses:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Understanding (NLU)**: Processes and understands complex natural language commands between AIs.
- **Multilingual support**: Supports communication in multiple languages for global interoperability.

##### 3.7. **Knowledge Sharing and Learning**
AI Agents can share learned knowledge for collaborative improvement:
- **Knowledge Graph integration**: Allows AIs to share knowledge and collaborate using a knowledge graph.
- **Continuous Learning**: Updates learning models in real-time as new data becomes available.

##### 3.8. **Trust Evaluation and Adjustment Between AIs**
Mechanisms for evaluating and adjusting trust between AI Agents are included:
- **Trust score allocation**: Each AI Agent is assigned a trust score based on the reliability of its performance.
- **Trust-based decision-making**: AIs use trust scores to determine whether to collaborate with other Agents.

##### 3.9. **Autonomous Collaboration and Decision-Making**
AI Agents can autonomously collaborate to complete tasks:
- **Autonomous task division**: Tasks are divided among Agents for efficient processing.
- **Decision-making mechanisms**: AI Agents autonomously make decisions based on provided data and inputs.

##### 3.10. **Scalability and Flexibility**
The interface is designed to be scalable and flexible for large-scale AI systems:
- **Cloud-native architecture support**: Easily scalable within cloud environments.
- **Modular interface**: Provides a modular design for flexible expansion of functionality as needed.

#### 4. **Conclusion**
This interface specification outlines the key functions required for enabling effective communication, collaboration, and trust between AI Agents. It ensures high reliability and security in AI-based service environments, allowing AI Agents to autonomously collaborate and perform complex tasks in a cooperative manner.
